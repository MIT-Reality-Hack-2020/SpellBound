## Overview

Spell Bound is a VR learning game to help children with dyslexia and dysgraphia learn letter formation and word recognition. An animated wizard guides them through the process of writing letters with a wand to complete magic words and then reading the word out loud to cast the spell.

The app is intended to be used only under the supervision of a qualified professional such as an occupational therapist or special-ed teacher.

The immersive nature of VR and the magical story elements keeps the child’s attention engaged while completing tasks that would otherwise frustrate them. Letter formation is most often taught in conjunction with handwriting, which is especially difficult for children with dyslexia/dysgraphia because of the fine motor skills handwriting requires. VR controllers rely primarily on arm movement for the interactions we designed, which allows the child to focus on letter formation separately from fine motor skills.

Performance is collected from gameplay into a dashboard which provides an assessment of the child’s development in improving their reading and writing skills. This information is used by the child’s instructor or reading/speech therapist to identify areas of improvement and determine the next course of action for instruction.
